### Project Background
Analysis of U.S. household income trends across states and counties to understand the impact of economic factors (mean and median income), land area, and income type distribution on regional income outcomes.

### Goals and Objectives
1. Identify states and counties with the highest and lowest average household incomes.
   
2. Analyze income trends across different income types and regions (e.g., urban vs. rural).
   
3. Handle data quality issues such as duplicates and missing values to ensure robust
analysis.

### Executive Summary
Analysis of worldwide life expectancy data reveals significant disparities between
developed and developing nations, with a strong correlation between GDP and life
outcomes. Key findings:
o 14.8 year gap between highest and lowest life expectancy countries

o Countries with GDP ≥$1,500 show 9.2 years higher life expectancy

o Developed nations average 7.4 years longer life expectancy than developing
ones
o Adult mortality trends show consistent decline in most regions

### Insights Deep-Dive
Life Expectancy Trends
1. Country-Level Changes (2000-2015)
o Maximum increase: 9.6 years
o Minimum increase: 1.2 years
o Average annual improvement: 0.32 years

2. Economic Impact
o High GDP (≥$1,500): 77.3 years average
o Low GDP (≤$1,500): 68.1 years average
o GDP correlation coefficient: 0.84

3. Development Status Impact
o Developed nations: 79.2 years
o Developing nations: 71.8 years

o Sample size: 32 developed, 161 developing countries


### Key Insights
1. Life Expectancy Trends
- Countries with higher GDP have significantly longer life expectancies.
- Developing nations exhibit greater variability in life expectancy growth over 15
years compared to developed nations.
2. Economic Status Analysis:
- Developed countries have an average life expectancy of 78 years, while
developing nations average 63 years.
3. BMI and Life Expectancy Correlation:
- Countries with lower average BMIs tend to have higher life expectancies,
suggesting health and nutrition disparities.
### Recommendations
1. Focus on Health Policies in Developing Nations:
Invest in healthcare infrastructure to address disparities in life expectancy.

2. Target Economic Growth:
Countries with higher GDP exhibit longer life expectancies; policies aimed at
economic development could improve overall health.

3. Address Nutrition and Obesity:
Encourage programs to manage BMI, as lower BMIs correlate with higher life
expectancy.
